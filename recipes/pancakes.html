    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Serve these pancakes with butter and syrup, or up the ante with toppings such as sprinkles, 
        chopped bittersweet chocolate, and sliced or chopped fruit for a perfect breakfast.  
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl. </li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.</li>
        <li>Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen; donâ€™t overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes. </li>
        <li> Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings. </li>
    </ol>
