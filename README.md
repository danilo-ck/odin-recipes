# My Recipe Website Project

## Introduction
Hey there! Welcome to my Recipe Website project, part of The Odin Project. I'm excited to share my journey as I learn to become a frontend developer.

## Project Overview
I'll be building a basic recipe website with a main index linking to some recipes. This project focuses on strengthening my HTML skills before diving into CSS styling.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I'll showcase:
- HTML fundamentals.
- Use of semantic HTML.
- Linking between pages.
- Document structure.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, I plan to return to this project to add CSS styling. For now, I'm focused on perfecting my HTML skills.

## Getting Started
If you want to follow along or try building your own recipe site, feel free to clone this repository and start editing the HTML files. Thanks for joining me on this journey!

Happy coding!
